1) What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

  -Invoking ping simple adds a period to the end of a statement which will not invoke a new line. Baffle adds the string "Wug" and does not create a new line. Neither of these create spaces. The main methods will print the string and then add a space because of the spacing in the quotation marks. The Zoop method is invoked in the second line of the block, zoop also creates a space because of spacing within quotation marks. Anywhere with the System class will create a new line in this case.

2) Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

  -The stack Diagram would look like:
  
      main    ____________
               No, I wug.
              ____________
  
3) What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

  -I believe that creates an infinite loop, you are constantly trying to call the ping method and then baffle which leads to a never ending loop. This creates a stack overflow error.
